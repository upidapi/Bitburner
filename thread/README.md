you run the script by running "thread/Scheduling/Controller.js"

is has auto everything so you shouldn't have to do anything 
    except the things that require singularity
    like for example buying / creating the port openers

if you want to you could add:
    calculations for hack %

    add a targeter that doesn't only care about the money per second
        Batching at a "worse" target might improve your situation by giving 
        you money sooner. 
        
        That might in turn result in faster scaling. since you might be able 
        to upgrade your servers faster, get programs faster. Which in turn
        makes everything go faster 
        
        And it might take a (very) long time to prep a server and you might 
        not what to use that server for a very long time so the total money
        per sec over the servers "use time" is worse than other options 
        
        An interesting challenge for those whom hate themselves
